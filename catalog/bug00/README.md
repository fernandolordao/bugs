I have logged on my bank account using the browser on the computer and tried to pay the following bill using the DDA feature.

After clicking on the desired identification code, the system jumped to the next screen as expected, but instead of my own data and my bill's data, the system exposed the data of another bill belonging together with its owner's private data, probably another customer of the bank.
