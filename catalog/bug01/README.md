Having no active session for my account, I went to the Q&A page and searched for a specific channel to report a bug. Instead, I found only the Chat feature and started talking to the agents. As the answers were lasting so much, I logged on my account in order to restart the conversation and have it linked to my account to continue any time later. Surprisingly, the on-the-way conversation has already been registered on my history, and I continue to talk on that. In this meanwhile, my session has expired, and for another surprise, my Chat history remained available, even letting me continue to interact with it for days as far as the browser remained opened.
