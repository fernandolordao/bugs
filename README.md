# Public list of bugs found by myself

All these bugs were found by myself while using the **default end-user interface** with **NO privileged access**. I do NOT receive any money or any other benefits, but I expect quality improvement on the respective services because I need to use them frequently.

I created this public catalog due to the chronic lack of attention provided by companies when I tried to make reports. So, this is my last try to catch someone's attention and help companies to understand the importance of taking care of their bugs.

The list that follows shows a brief description of the bugs and respective links to further details. On the page/directory of each bug, there are an extended description and artifacts like screenshots and videos, all of them obfuscated accordingly.

FOR COMPANIES: If you need undisclosed data, refer to the channel where I initially reported according to each bug, or give me the honor of hearing from you.
